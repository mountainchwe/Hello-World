# Hello-World
Hello world, I am Umaira Yusra and I am a Computer Engineering major student in Kyung Hee University, Suwon, South Korea.
Growing up, computer and technology has always been something that I am interested in but if I were to be honest, due to the fast development of the industry, I now more often than not, feel overwhelmed thinking about what I were to choose as my speciality in the field.
Despite all that, I feel excited about starting my GitHub account as this means one step closer to more exploration in the field and me facing my fears.
